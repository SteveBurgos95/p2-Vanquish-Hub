# Rate Me App

## Project Description

Its an API to draw and practise based on the Pokemon. A user will be able to log in to our website. From there, they can either look at their past drawings, look at other people's drawings, organised by either time of posting (by most recent) or by most popular, able to rate each other's drawings. If they desire, the user can also play a game. In single player, the user will receive a random pokemon. From there, they attempt to draw said pokemon in the canvas screen. When done, their drawing is put side by side with the original art. The user can then download it, upload it and save it, or delete it. The user can attempt this with a hint, the pokemon sprite next to their drawing, or blind. A 1 on 1 feature could be added where a person attempts to draw a pokemon within a set period of time. Once done, the other person gets the image and can try and guess what pokemon it is that the other person drew up.
